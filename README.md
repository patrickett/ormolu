# Ormolu

## Name

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ormolu): Ormolu is the gilding technique of applying finely ground, high-carat goldâ€“mercury amalgam to an object of bronze, and objects finished in this way.

## Status

**Current status: IN DEVELOPMENT - ORMOLU is not ready for production usage. The API
is still evolving and documentation is lacking.**

Ormolu tries to bring a good developer experience to working with relational databases in Rust.
Reducing cruft and boilerplate where possible while maintaining an idomatic feel.

Currently I am only focusing on supporting PostgreSQL.
I will accept PR's for adding other database support.

### Database as a source of truth

Ormolu expects that what exists in the database is the proper intended way things
should be. So the `ormolu-cli` will generate all the types to interact with the tables
in the database for you.

Changes should happen at/in the database and then you should rerun the `ormolu-cli` to make sure any
changes are reflected in the types.

### Usage

```bash
ormolu generate -d "postgres://username:password@host/database?currentSchema=my_schema" -o ./src/db/
```

### Example

```Rust
use ormolu::*;

#[derive(Table)]
#[name = "public.customer"]
pub struct Customer {
    id: PrimaryKey<Self, i32>,
    first_name: String,
    last_name: String,
    email: Unique<String>,
    phone_number: Option<Unique<String>>,
    created_at: chrono::NaiveDateTime,
    updated_at: chrono::NaiveDateTime,
}

#[derive(Table)]
#[name = "public.order"]
pub struct Order {
    id: PrimaryKey<Self, i32>,
    customer_id: ForeignKey<Customer, 1, i32>,
    order_date: chrono::NaiveDateTime,
    total_amount: f64,
    status: String,
    name: String,
    shipping_address: String,
    created_at: chrono::NaiveDateTime,
    updated_at: chrono::NaiveDateTime,
}
```

```rust
// The `find_by_email` method is automatically generated since 'email' is marked unique in the database.
let john = Customer::find_by_email("jdoe@example.com").await?;

let johns_orders: Vec<Order> = john.orders().order_by_asc(|o| o.order_date);

// for order in johns_orders {
//     println!("{}", order.name);
// }

if let Some(newest_order) = johns_orders.first() {
    // This is just demonstrating the relation capability, we have the customer above.
    let cust = newest_order.customer().await?;
    println!(
        "{} newest order's total was {}",
        cust.first_name, newest_order.total_amount
    );
}
```

### Todos

- Is there a way we can try to perform a fetch or something but if it fails check
  if the db schema has changed and if so throw an error that alerts that we are out of sync
- prepared queries https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/rqb#multiple-placeholders (query.prepare())
- if each column in the table has a default value we can implement a Derive default impl
